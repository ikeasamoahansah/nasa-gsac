Based on the historical data and current values, predict the likelihood of rainfall and potential weather changes. Provide a detailed explanation of the prediction, highlighting the most influential factors and their impact on the result.

        2. A probability assessment for rainfall.
        3. Recommendations for the user based on predicted weather conditions.
        4. A visual representation of the data (plot/graph) showing temperature, precipitation, and wind speed trends over time.
